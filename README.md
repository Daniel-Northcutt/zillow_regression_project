/2

Your readme should include useful and adequate instructions for reproducing your analysis and final report.


/3

Your readme should include a clear project goal that reflect on what you are trying to achieve for the business/organization (in the scenario layed out). Your goal is never just to create an algorithm or model or to purely make discoveries in exploration...it includes the why. "My goal is to..., so that..." Your goal should be specific enough to know when you have reached it and concise enough to keep in 1-2 sentences. "My goal is to identify key drivers of churn, which customers at risk of churn, and make recommendations for changes so that we can reduce the monthly churn rate and increase customer retention." This helps tell you when you have reached a minimally viable product (including a presentation and predictions, in this example scenario).


/2

Your readme should include initial questions and focus you are going into the analysis with. This is an important part of project planning and gives context to the reader about where you started, what were your initial ideas and thoughts, and did those play out to be true.
